[Video Demonstrations in Lasers and Optics](/courses/res-6-006-video-demonstrations-in-lasers-and-optics-spring-2008)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains demonstrations used to illustrate the theory and applications of optics. Some of the topics superbly treated in Prof. Shaoul Ezekiel's Demonstrations in Lasers and Optics videos include light polarization, reflections at boundaries, Brewster's angle, critical angle, Fraunhofer diffraction from slits, optical fibers, and lasers. In addition to presentation of Prof. Ezekiel's video segments in lectures and recitations, students viewed segments of Prof. Ezekiel's Optics videos. Homework problems based on phenomena in the videos were also prepared and assigned.

[Electromagnetic Field Theory](/courses/res-6-002-electromagnetic-field-theory-a-problem-solving-approach-spring-2008)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This text is an introduction at the junior level to electromagnetic field theory. The course starts with the Coulomb-Lorentz force law on a point charge. The theory is extended by the continuous superposition of solutions from previously developed simpler problems leading to the general integral and differential field laws. This book features many worked examples emphasizing physical processes, devices, and models.
